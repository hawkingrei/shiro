# 2026-02-28 Journal Migration

## Completed

- Moved historical `AGENTS.md` `## Recent updates` entries to:
  - `docs/journal/2026-02-28-recent-updates-migrated.md`
- Replaced `AGENTS.md` `## Recent updates` with journal pointers.
- Updated workflow policy to log completed work in `docs/journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>-*.md`.
- Updated `docs/todo.md` to keep open tasks only and point completed work to journal files.
- Added `docs/journal/AGENTS.md` with journal naming and logging rules.

## Validation

- Confirmed migrated log file exists and contains historical updates.
- Confirmed `AGENTS.md` links now point to `docs/journal/AGENTS.md`.
- Confirmed `docs/todo.md` no longer references completed logs in TODO.
