# Journal Guide

This directory stores completion logs for agents.

## File naming

- Use date-first file names: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
- Use one or more files per day as needed.

## What to log

- What changed (code/docs/config/tests/issues).
- Why it was changed (brief motivation).
- Validation evidence (tests/commands/outcomes).
- Follow-up items that remain open.
- Before closing a task, identify at least one concrete improvement opportunity and add it to `docs/todo.md`.

## Relationship with other docs

- `docs/todo.md`: open tasks only.
- `docs/journal/*`: completed work logs.
- `AGENTS.md`: workflow policy and pointers.
