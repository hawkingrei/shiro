# 2026-02-28 Post-Task Improvement Policy

## Completed

- Added workflow rule in `AGENTS.md`: after each completed task, add actionable improvement items to `docs/todo.md`.
- Updated `docs/journal/AGENTS.md` to require identifying at least one concrete improvement before closing a task.
- Updated `docs/todo.md` policy text and added a `Continuous Improvement` section with open follow-up items.
- Removed `## Recent updates` from root `AGENTS.md` and replaced it with a stable `## Workflow` section.
- Added a TODO improvement item to enforce this via doc lint (no `## Recent updates` in root `AGENTS.md`).

## Validation

- Confirmed policy text exists in:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `docs/journal/AGENTS.md`
  - `docs/todo.md`
- Confirmed root `AGENTS.md` now contains `## Workflow` and no longer includes `## Recent updates`.
