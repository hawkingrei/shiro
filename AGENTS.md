## Workflow guardrails

- After each task completes, review and update `AGENTS.md` and `docs/todo.md`, removing completed items and syncing current progress.
- Documentation must be written in English.
- When updating TiDB issues, collapse large SQL blocks (apply schema/load data) in `<details>` and format the "Run the query" SQL for readability.

## Signal policy

- Non-reproducible cases are still valid signals: do not suppress case capture only because current minimize/replay cannot reproduce yet.
- Inapplicable/invalid optimizer hints are also test signals: keep observing and logging these outcomes instead of filtering them out by default, because behavior changes over time can make previously inapplicable hints become applicable.
- Prefer generation-time constraints over runtime skip growth: when a skip class is predictable from query/schema context, add guardrails in generator/query-builder/oracle profile constraints first to reduce skip volume at the source.
- For unavoidable skips, keep observability first-class: require stable `skip_reason` taxonomy plus interval/detail diagnostics and counters so skip drift remains measurable in logs/reports.

## Recent updates
- Added warning observability for unknown non-MySQL replay errors (2026-02-28): minimize replay error matching now emits a WARN log when non-MySQL errors cannot be classified by known keywords (or only one side is classified), so potential `base_replay_not_reproducible` skips caused by unknown runtime errors are visible in logs instead of silent mismatch-only behavior. Added helper coverage in `internal/runner/minimize_replay_test.go`; validated with `go test ./internal/runner`.
- Refined minimize error matching and tie-breaker completion per PR review follow-ups (2026-02-28): `errorMatches` now uses MySQL code equality plus keyword-class overlap (and keyword-only fallback for non-MySQL errors) instead of code-only matching, reducing false-positive replay matches for broad codes like `1105` while still handling timeout-class non-MySQL errors. Also updated LIMIT ORDER BY tie-breaker completion to append all missing deterministic ORDER keys (removed single-append `break`) so deterministic completion does not stop early. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/minimize_replay_test.go` and `internal/generator/generator_test.go`; validated with `go test ./internal/runner ./internal/generator`.
- Fixed DQP base-error minimize replay path (2026-02-28): when DQP base signature execution fails, oracle details now persist replay metadata (`replay_kind=error_sql`, `replay_expected_sql=<signature_sql>`), and runner minimize now prioritizes replay details even for error results (instead of always falling back to `case_error` SQL replay). Added `error_sql` replay execution support in minimize and repro SQL generation. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/minimize_replay_test.go` and `internal/runner/minimize_core_refactor_test.go`; validated with `go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle`.
- Improved minimize AST reduction for predicate and CTE count simplification (2026-02-28): minimizer now emits recursive boolean-branch reduction candidates for `WHERE`/`HAVING` (nested `AND`/`OR` branches) and supports dropping individual CTE entries from multi-CTE `WITH` clauses (`2 -> 1`) for both `SELECT` and set-operation statements. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/minimize_test.go`; validated with `go test ./internal/runner -run 'Test.*Minimize|TestSelectCandidates.*'`.
- Added DQP hint-length observability (2026-02-28): DQP now emits per-run hint length metrics (`dqp_hint_length_min/max/sum/count`), and runner interval logging includes `dqp_hint_len_min/avg/max/count` in `dqp_variant_metrics last interval` so hint-size drift is visible directly from logs. Added tests in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_stats_test.go`; validated with `go test ./internal/oracle ./internal/runner`.
- Split DQP MPP hints into a dedicated variant group and overlaid MPP into combined hints (2026-02-27): DQP now tags MPP-only set-var variants as `mpp_hint` (fifth group), keeps MPP set-vars prioritized when composing `combined_hint` variants, and switches MPP opposite-pair logic so `tidb_enforce_mpp` pairs with `tidb_allow_mpp=OFF` (with fallback) rather than relying on `tidb_enforce_mpp=OFF`; built-in enforce-off candidate emission was removed. Added regression coverage in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` and validated with `go test ./internal/config ./internal/oracle`.
- Narrowed DQP set-var mutation to one variable per run (2026-02-27): DQP set-var selection now picks a single set-var variable each run and emits at most one ON/OFF pair for that variable (bounded by pick max), preventing multi-variable set-var mutations in a single DQP execution. Updated DQP set-var tests for focused one-variable behavior and validated with `go test ./internal/config ./internal/oracle`.
- Removed deprecated DQP `INL_MERGE_JOIN` hint emission (2026-02-27): DQP no longer emits `INL_MERGE_JOIN` in either query-aware join-hint candidates or legacy DQP hint candidate construction, reducing deprecation warning noise from variant execution. Validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Made DQP hint injection query/schema-aware for warning reduction (2026-02-27): DQP now gates join hints by query join shape (strict hints like `LEADING`, `INL_*`, and `HASH_JOIN_BUILD/PROBE` only emit on all-inner non-derived joins), restricts INL targets to indexed join tables, and derives index hints from table/index structure plus WHERE predicate shape (`USE_INDEX_MERGE` now requires multi-index potential and OR-disjunction predicates on the hinted table). Added regression tests in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` for outer-join gating, indexed inner-join targeting, and index-merge shape gating. Validated with `go test ./internal/config ./internal/oracle`.
- Aligned runtime `config.yaml` DQP hint pick limits with defaults (2026-02-27): changed local run config `oracles.dqp_base_hint_pick_limit` and `oracles.dqp_set_var_hint_pick_max` from `6/8` to `4/4` so runtime behavior matches current default/example limits. Validated with `go test ./internal/config`.
- Increased default DQP hint pick limits to 4 (2026-02-27): raised default `oracles.dqp_base_hint_pick_limit` and `oracles.dqp_set_var_hint_pick_max` from `3` to `4` in both config normalization/defaults and `config.example.yaml`, and updated DQP default-limit regression assertions. Validated with `go test ./internal/config ./internal/oracle`.
- Reduced default subquery recursion depth to 2 (2026-02-27): lowered generator fallback `maxSubqDepth` from `3` to `2` so default SQL generation stays shallower and avoids excessive nested subqueries by default. Validated with `go test ./internal/generator`.
- Reduced default CTE cap to 2 (2026-02-27): lowered generator fallback `CTECountMax` from `3` to `2`, updated `defaultConfig()` `weights.features.cte_count_max` to `2`, and synced `config.example.yaml` so default runs generate fewer CTEs and stay less complex. Validated with `go test ./internal/config ./internal/generator`.
- Expanded DQP join-table counting with CTE-aware complexity accounting (2026-02-27): DQP now treats join-table complexity as top-level FROM tables plus CTE contributions (CTE itself and recursively counted CTE-body tables), and feeds that count into both DQP complexity guard (`constraint:dqp_complexity_join_tables`) and set-var table-count handling. This reduces complex CTE-shaped candidate queries while keeping non-CTE behavior stable. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` (`TestDQPJoinTableCountIncludesCTEAndBodyTables`, `TestDQPComplexityGuardReasonJoinTablesWithCTE`) and validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Tightened DQP set-var sampling to enforce MPP coverage when TiFlash is available (2026-02-27): for join queries with MPP enabled and TiFlash replicas configured, DQP now guarantees at least one MPP set-var hint (`tidb_allow_mpp`/`tidb_enforce_mpp`) in sampled set-var variants; when the sampled set-var count is greater than one, DQP also keeps non-MPP set-vars for mixed optimizer coverage. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` (`TestDQPShouldRequireMPPSetVar`, `TestDQPSetVarHintsRequireMPPWhenTiFlashReplicaAvailable`, `TestDQPSetVarHintsKeepMPPAndNonMPPWhenLimitAllows`) and validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Added optimizer-focused DQP MPP set-var toggles for `tidb_allow_mpp` and `tidb_enforce_mpp` (2026-02-27): join-path set-var candidates now include ON/OFF pairs for both switches, and regression coverage now validates them separately (`include_allow`, `include_enforce`, `skip_allow_when_disabled`, `skip_enforce_when_disabled`) plus no-join exclusion checks. Validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Enforced DQP multi-hint-group consistency checks (2026-02-27): DQP variants now carry explicit hint-group labels (`base_hint`, `set_var_hint`, `combined_hint`, `index_hint`), and runtime validation now requires at least two executed hint groups before accepting a DQP run; otherwise it skips with `skip_reason=dqp:insufficient_hint_groups` and group diagnostics (`hint_groups`, `hint_group_count`). Added regression coverage in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` for group formatting and multi-group variant construction, validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Added DQP execute-time warning logging via `SHOW WARNINGS` (2026-02-27): DQP signature execution now runs with per-query session warning capture (`QuerySignatureWithWarnings`) and logs non-empty warnings in detail logs with stage (`base`/`variant`), hint, compact SQL, and sampled warning payload; this enables direct diagnosis when plan-variant execution triggers warnings without causing mismatches. Added helper coverage in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` (`TestDQPWarningSample`, `TestDQPCompactSQL`) and validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Extended EET unstable-window guards to window aggregates (2026-02-27): EET now skips queries with `skip_reason=eet:window_agg_unstable_order` when window aggregate functions have unstable ordering (`ORDER BY` empty/all-constant, or partition-only non-unique tie ordering), instead of only guarding rank-family functions. Refactored unstable-window traversal into a reusable checker shared by rank and aggregate paths, and added regression tests in `internal/oracle/eet_test.go` for no-order / non-unique-tie / tie-breaker cases. Validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Applied FK-check guarding for replay/export inserts and fixed Impo set-op polarity propagation (2026-02-27): runner report export now wraps `inserts.sql` and `min/inserts.sql` with `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0/1`, and minimize replay now executes insert replay under session-level FK-check off/on wrappers to avoid replay-only `Cannot add or update a child row` noise after minimized DDL ordering changes. Impo set-op traversal now flips branch polarity on `EXCEPT`/`EXCEPT ALL` right operands so mutations such as `FixMOn1U` keep correct direction classification instead of reversed false positives. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_report_test.go`, `internal/runner/minimize_replay_test.go`, and `internal/oracle/impo/setop_flag_test.go`; validated with `go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle/impo`.
- Added DQP hint observability counters (2026-02-27): DQP now reports per-run metrics `dqp_hint_injected_total`, `dqp_hint_fallback_total`, and `dqp_set_var_variant_total`; runner aggregates and emits them in interval logs via `dqp_variant_metrics last interval` so hint-injection behavior is directly trackable from runtime logs. Added tests in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_stats_test.go`; validated with `go test ./internal/oracle ./internal/runner` (temp cache dirs).
- Re-enabled minimize for downgraded missing-column skips (2026-02-27): `eet`/`impo`/`pqs` missing-column false positives now keep skip taxonomy while preserving error context for replay; runner now captures these skip-marked results for `case_error` minimize instead of forcing `not_applicable`. Added regression coverage in `internal/runner/runner_errors_test.go` and validated with `go test ./internal/runner`.
- Added FK data-compatibility precheck before `ADD FOREIGN KEY` DDL (2026-02-27): runner now validates generated FK candidates against current table data via `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL` probe SQL and skips incompatible candidates before executing DDL, reducing `ddl:1452` noise from orphan child values. Added FK compatibility SQL tests in `internal/runner/runner_utils_test.go` and validated with `go test ./internal/runner`.
- Adjusted default action weights to a query-heavy baseline (2026-02-27): default `weights.actions` is now `ddl=1, dml=1, query=10` (was `1/3/6`) in both `defaultConfig()` and `config.example.yaml`, with config regression assertions added in `internal/config/config_test.go`.
- Reduced foreign-key 1452 noise in DML/DDL paths (2026-02-27): insert generation now applies FK-aware value construction (including id->id parent-range gating) and skips unsafe rows when parent ranges are exhausted; update generation no longer mutates FK columns; FK DDL generation now skips guaranteed-fail id->id additions when child id ranges already exceed parent ranges. Runner now skips empty generated INSERT statements. Added regression tests in `internal/generator/generator_dml_fk_test.go` and validated with `go test ./internal/generator ./internal/runner`.
- Made DQP complexity thresholds configurable and moved complexity gating into generation retries (2026-02-27): added `oracles.dqp_complexity_set_ops_threshold` and `oracles.dqp_complexity_derived_threshold` (default `2/3`), and wired DQP complexity checks through `QueryGuardReason` so builder retries can filter complex candidates before final skip classification. Removed the post-build DQP complexity skip path, updated config/oracle regression tests, and synced README/config docs.
- Aligned MPP-enable normalization to enforce TiFlash replica presence (2026-02-27): when MPP is enabled (`disable_mpp=false` / `mpp.enable=true`), config normalization now forces `mpp_tiflash_replica` to at least `1` (including explicit/legacy zero values), so MPP-enabled runs always provision TiFlash replicas by default. Updated config tests and docs/examples accordingly.
- Skipped TiFlash replica DDL in `plan_cache_only` runs (2026-02-27): runner now treats `plan_cache_only` as ineligible for TiFlash replica provisioning, so init-state setup no longer issues `ALTER TABLE ... SET TIFLASH REPLICA` in focused plan-cache mode; this avoids unrelated MPP side effects while validating prepared plan-cache behavior.
- Disabled MPP in prepared plan-cache paths (2026-02-27): runner now applies session-level `SET SESSION tidb_allow_mpp=OFF` (and attempts `tidb_enforce_mpp=OFF`) before prepared plan-cache execution in both normal `runPrepared` and `plan_cache_only` flows, with compatibility fallback for unknown system variables. Added unit coverage in `internal/runner/runner_plan_cache_test.go` for statement set and ignore-error classification, and documented behavior in README.
- Added top-level `mpp` config entrypoint while preserving legacy oracle keys (2026-02-26): Shiro now supports `mpp.enable` and `mpp.tiflash_replica` as the primary MPP controls (`mpp.enable=false` disables Shiro-managed MPP paths), while still accepting `oracles.disable_mpp` and `oracles.mpp_tiflash_replica` for backward compatibility; normalization keeps both views aligned. Updated config defaults/tests and README/config examples.
- Added global MPP-disable switch for Shiro-managed paths (2026-02-26): introduced `oracles.disable_mpp` so MPP exploration can be shut off from config; when enabled, runner skips TiFlash replica provisioning (`ALTER TABLE ... SET TIFLASH REPLICA`) and DQP drops built-in/external MPP `SET_VAR` candidates (`tidb_allow_mpp`, `tidb_enforce_mpp`). Added config parsing/default coverage and DQP/runner regression tests, and synced README/config docs.
- Aligned TiFlash readiness timeout error semantics (2026-02-26): `waitTiFlashReplicaReady` now returns explicit `wait tiflash replica ready timeout` on readiness timeout (instead of generic context deadline text), while preserving cancel-path errors; this keeps replica-not-ready failures directly triageable.
- Tightened TiFlash replica readiness gating for MPP (2026-02-26): runner now uses fixed global gating after each `ALTER TABLE ... SET TIFLASH REPLICA <n>` by polling every 100ms until `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tiflash_replica WHERE AVAILABLE=0` reaches `0` (2-minute timeout), matching test-style readiness checks; removed the temporary `oracles.mpp_tiflash_wait_seconds` knob, updated helper/config tests, and synced README/config docs.
- Added TiFlash replica provisioning for MPP exploration (2026-02-26): introduced `oracles.mpp_tiflash_replica` and runner-side table-create hooks that issue `ALTER TABLE ... SET TIFLASH REPLICA <n>` for base tables after successful creation (initial state, DSG init, and runtime `create_table` DDL); added helper/unit coverage in `internal/runner/runner_utils_test.go`, config coverage in `internal/config/config_test.go`, and updated README/config docs. Validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp go test ./internal/config ./internal/runner`.
- Added TiDB MPP hint coverage in DQP (2026-02-26): DQP built-in `SET_VAR` candidates now include `tidb_allow_mpp=ON/OFF` for join queries so optimizer differential runs can explicitly explore MPP-enabled vs MPP-disabled plans; added regression coverage in `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp go test ./internal/oracle`.
- Refreshed config baselines (2026-02-22): expanded `config.example.yaml` from a placeholder comment to a complete, secret-free reference config aligned with code defaults, changed `defaultConfig()` to enable QPG by default (`qpg.enabled=true`), and lowered default view cap to `view_max=3`; added default assertion coverage in `internal/config/config_test.go` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp go test ./internal/...`.

- Added configurable CODDTest CASE branch cap (2026-02-24): introduced `oracles.coddtest_case_when_max` (default `20`) and applied it in `internal/oracle/coddtest.go` dependent rewrite generation so generated `CASE WHEN` predicates are bounded and less likely to produce oversized queries; also added rows.Err handling and regression tests in `internal/config/config_test.go` and `internal/oracle/coddtest_test.go`, plus README/config docs updates.
- Filed TiDB compatibility issue #66345 for reproducible CODDTest case `case_0003_019c8e4e-4d8c-7e70-bf1e-8f5f22bd29d3` (2026-02-24): documented TiDB/MySQL divergence where rewritten CASE predicate query returns 0 rows on TiDB but reports MySQL `1525 Incorrect DATETIME value: '99.55'`; included formatted repro SQL and collapsed schema/load-data block in the upstream issue.
- Completed report taxonomy ownership normalization (2026-02-22): `internal/runner/runner_errors.go` now lets runner canonical classification override only oracle-pre-filled generic `*:sql_error[_code]` reasons when runner can derive a more specific reason, while preserving non-generic oracle reasons and retaining forced `pqs:runtime_1105` canonicalization. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_errors_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Fixed PQS runtime-1105 report canonicalization (2026-02-22): `internal/runner/runner_errors.go` now forces `error_reason=pqs:runtime_1105` + `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error` for runtime index-out-of-range errors even when oracle details include generic `pqs:sql_error_1105`, preventing taxonomy drift between oracle and runner classification layers. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_errors_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Added design ADR `docs/decisions/2026-02-22-adaptive-syntax-capability-pipeline.md` (2026-02-22): defines a staged syntax capability expansion pipeline (capability registry + deterministic generator/runner gates + rollout thresholds) and documents a taxonomy consistency gap where oracle-pre-filled `pqs:sql_error_1105` can bypass runner canonicalization to `pqs:runtime_1105`; follow-up implementation will target runner/oracle classification ownership with regression tests.
- Addressed PR #132 review follow-ups for plan-cache table candidate filtering (2026-02-22): simplified `preparedCandidateTables` and `nonPreparedCandidateTables` in `internal/generator/generator_prepared.go` to reuse `schema.State.BaseTables()` for view exclusion paths, removing redundant filtering/allocation while keeping behavior unchanged. Re-validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/generator` and `... go test ./internal/runner`.
- Strengthened QPG mutate table targeting for view-heavy schemas (2026-02-22): `qpgMutate` now prioritizes base tables for index/analyze mutations, and when only views are available it resolves view dependencies through `information_schema.VIEW_TABLE_USAGE` + `TABLES` (`BASE TABLE` only) and samples a bounded set of fallback analyze targets instead of issuing `ANALYZE TABLE <view>`. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_qpg_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Adjusted P0 runtime-1105 reporting policy after triage review (2026-02-21): keep `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error` for `error_reason=pqs:runtime_1105` even when minimize is non-success, and switch reproducibility handling to metadata-only (`runtime_bug_reproducible`, `runtime_bug_hint_gated`, `runtime_bug_hint_gate_reason`) so runtime bug signals are preserved while replay confidence remains explicit. Updated runner tests and README/triage notes; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Expanded P0 runtime-1105 reproducibility gate validation and docs (2026-02-21): added `disabled` and `not_applicable` regression coverage for `applyRuntime1105ReproGate`, including gate-reason preservation when `runtime_bug_hint_gate_reason` is pre-filled; documented runtime gate behavior/fields (`runtime_bug_hint_gated`, `runtime_bug_hint_gate_reason`) in `README.md`. Validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Completed P0 runtime-1105 reproducibility gate (2026-02-19): added runner-side gating so `error_reason=pqs:runtime_1105` only keeps `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error` when minimize reproduces (`minimize_status=success`); unreproducible/non-success paths now clear runtime bug hints and record `runtime_bug_hint_gated=true` in details to keep report-side runtime channels reproducibility-backed. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_report_test.go` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Closed P0 PQS runtime-1105 follow-up with evidence-driven triage (2026-02-19): added `docs/notes/pqs-runtime-1105-triage.md` and confirmed that the historical 2026-02-09 `PQS` MySQL `1105` (`index out of range`) signal remains non-reproducible with zero matches in current local `reports/*/summary.json`; decision is to keep runtime classification (`pqs:runtime_1105` + `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error`) and defer upstream issue filing until a reproducible sample appears.
- Started P0 PQS runtime-1105 triage hardening (2026-02-19): runner error classification now maps `PQS` MySQL `1105` errors that include `index out of range` to a dedicated reason `pqs:runtime_1105` with `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error`, so report aggregation can isolate this suspected engine-runtime class from generic `sql_error_1105`; also replaced timeout MySQL magic codes with named constants in runner error helpers. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_errors_test.go` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Fixed `revive` `confusing-results` lint findings in `internal/oracle/dqp.go` by switching `dqpExprConstBool` and `dqpLiteralAsBool` to named return values (`value`, `ok`) without behavior changes; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle` (2026-02-19).
- Continued logs/reports throughput hardening (2026-02-19, infra-aware fuzz adaptation): runner now tracks infra-unhealthy signals (`region_unavailable`, `schema_out_of_date`, `tikv_connectivity`) and feeds them into throughput controls with TTL-based unhealthy state; oracle scheduling now de-prioritizes heavy oracles under infra-unhealthy windows (`DQP`/`GroundTruth` disabled, `TLP`/`DQE` capped) while oracle timeout/infra ratios are penalized in oracle-bandit batch rewards; per-oracle query timeout now applies a stricter cap when infra-unhealthy is active (`infraOracleTimeoutCapMs=3000`), and interval logs now emit infra health markers/reason deltas (`infra_unhealthy`, `infra_ttl`, `infra_error_reasons`). Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_throughput_guard_test.go`, `internal/runner/runner_errors_test.go`, and `internal/runner/runner_bandit_reward_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Completed verification run for latest DQP hint/scope tuning (2026-02-19): re-ran targeted suites `./internal/config`, `./internal/oracle`, and `./internal/runner` with Go 1.25.7 + temp cache dirs, then executed short `go run ./cmd/shiro -config config.yaml` runtime smoke. Latest interval kept `sql_valid/total=5665/5665` with DQP stable at `run/66 eff/64 skip/2 err/0` and skip reasons limited to `dqp:scope_invalid` (no new `dqp:sql_error_1054` captured in this run window).
- Continued logs/reports follow-up (2026-02-19, DQP runtime hints + NATURAL JOIN scope): made DQP hint sampling limits config-driven via `oracles.dqp_base_hint_pick_limit` and `oracles.dqp_set_var_hint_pick_max` (default `3/3`, local `config.yaml` tuned to `6/8`) so runtime hint breadth can be raised without code edits; also disabled `NaturalJoins` in the DQP profile to reduce NATURAL-join-qualified-column `sql_error_1054` noise seen in short smoke runs. Added/updated tests in `internal/config/config_test.go`, `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go`, and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/config`, `... go test ./internal/oracle`, `... go test ./internal/runner`, plus repeated short `go run ./cmd/shiro -config config.yaml` checks (no immediate DQP 1054 recurrences in subsequent windows).
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, GroundTruth + NATURAL JOIN noise): tightened GroundTruth edge arbitration to prefer all-inner edge sets when key completeness is not worse, preventing non-inner SQL-edge selection from inflating `groundtruth:join_type` skips; additionally disabled `NaturalJoins` in NoREC/TLP oracle profiles to reduce NATURAL-join-qualified-column `sql_error_1054` noise. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle/groundtruth_oracle_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`, and repeated `go run ./cmd/shiro -config config.yaml` smoke runs showing `GroundTruth` interval effectiveness recovered to `skip=0.000/effective=1.000`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, GroundTruth): reduced `groundtruth:join_type` skip pressure by tightening GroundTruth pick-time filters to reject non-inner extracted edge sets (not only non-inner generated joins), and added profile-level GroundTruth join-size cap (`max_join_tables=4`) applied via oracle overrides to avoid overly wide joins degrading effectiveness. Added regression coverage in `internal/oracle/groundtruth_oracle_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, DQP runtime hints): increased runtime DQP hint sampling slightly to improve per-query plan-variant coverage by raising base-hint pick limit from 2 to 3 and set-var hint pick range from `0..2` to `0..3`; updated DQP regression assertions accordingly. Validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle -run "TestDQPSetVarHintsCount|TestDQPHintsForQueryCount|TestDQP.*"` and `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, EET): reduced `eet:non_select` skip noise by disallowing set operations in the EET profile, adding EET query-spec guardrails (`DisallowSetOps` with `constraint:set_ops -> eet:set_ops`), and explicitly classifying parser `SetOprStmt` as `eet:set_ops` instead of generic `eet:non_select` for clearer diagnostics. Added regression coverage in `internal/oracle/eet_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, P1/P2): tightened DQP query shaping for throughput stability by disabling derived tables/set operations in the DQP profile, forcing simple join-on policy for DQP, and adding builder constraints (`DisallowSetOps`, `MaxJoinCount=3`) plus `dqp:set_ops` skip mapping so high-complexity DQP candidates are filtered earlier; GroundTruth query picking now retries away from non-inner joins (`groundTruthHasOnlyInnerJoins`) instead of terminating a run on first unsupported join shape, reducing `groundtruth:join_type` skip pressure. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle` and `internal/runner`, validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19): added low-sample throughput guard in runner interval stats (`minSQLTotalPerInterval=200`, streak-triggered guard TTL with auto-recovery), DQP timeout cooldown gating in oracle selection, per-oracle timeout capping for DQP (`dqpOracleTimeoutCapMs=5000`), and interval observability enhancements (`qps`, low-sample/guard/cooldown state, timeout-reason deltas, `inflight_minimize`, and `stalled_reason`). Throughput guard now temporarily disables heavy generation features (set operations, derived tables, quantified subqueries, window funcs/frames, and high join-table caps) via oracle overrides while active. Added runner regression tests for guard activation, cooldown behavior, oracle-weight gating, timeout cap, and override feature throttling; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports follow-up batch for P0/P1/P2 (2026-02-18): runner now downgrades DQP timeout outcomes (`context deadline exceeded`, timeout-like MySQL codes 1317/3024) from bug capture to skip (`skip_reason=dqp:timeout`) to reduce low-value timeout cases; GroundTruth DSG query picking now broadens fallback eligibility to `base_table` (in addition to `right_key`) and increases fallback retries (`groundTruthDSGFallbackRetries=12`) to reduce strict DSG skip pressure; generator full-join candidate shaping now remains active in DSG mode so 2-table FULL JOIN emulation paths can still be sampled. Added/updated regression tests in `internal/runner`, `internal/oracle`, and `internal/generator`, validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Completed logs/reports follow-up batch (2026-02-18): EET now skips unstable rank-window signatures (`skip_reason=eet:window_rank_unstable_order`) when `ROW_NUMBER`/`RANK`/`DENSE_RANK` uses empty/constant ordering or partition-only ordering, reducing missing-column-like false captures from nondeterministic ties; GroundTruth now prefers DSG-valid edge sets during SQL-AST vs query-edge selection and allows a bounded non-DSG fallback pick path when strict DSG fails on `right_key` mismatch; PQS pivot picking now includes a shuffled table-scan fallback before returning `pqs:no_rows`. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle` and `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner -run 'TestCollectGroundTruthDSGMismatchReasons|TestGroundTruthDSGMismatchReasonFromDetails|TestAnnotateResultForReportingGroundTruthMismatch'`.
- Completed fuzz follow-up batch for log/report optimization items 2/3/4/5 (2026-02-17): runner now downgrades EET/Impo/PQS `missing_column` outcomes from bug capture to skip (`skip_reason=<oracle>:missing_column`) to reduce false-positive case capture noise; GroundTruth edge selection now prefers DSG-valid edge sets before missing-key scoring and uses higher pick retries (`groundTruthPickRetries=16`) to reduce DSG mismatch skips; TQS mode switching now clears detached walker/history state and TQS interval logging now resets baseline on history rewind to avoid negative deltas after mode/database switches; generator table-picking now adds a dedicated 2-table candidate path when full-join emulation is enabled to improve `full_join_emulation` feature coverage. Added regression tests in `internal/runner`, `internal/oracle`, and `internal/generator`, validated with `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/generator`, `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle`, and `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner` using temp cache dirs.
- Completed Generator/Oracles grouping-mode extension for TODO item #4 (2026-02-17): added SQL build support for `GROUP BY CUBE (...)` and `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (...)`, introduced `features.group_by_cube` and `features.group_by_grouping_sets`, centralized generator group-by extension selection/fallback logic, and wired profile-based fallback by disabling CUBE/GROUPING SETS in CERT/EET profiles while preserving rollup/plain behavior; added generator/config/runner regression tests and validated with `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/config`, `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/generator`, and `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner` (using temp `GOCACHE`/`GOTMPDIR`).
- Implemented fuzz optimization batch for follow-up items 1/2/3/4 (2026-02-16): fixed DSG join-key offset alignment (`tN -> k(N-1)`) in generator and GroundTruth checks to reduce `dsg_key_mismatch_right_key` skips, changed DQP hint bandit reward plus mismatch `replay_set_var` extraction for `SET_VAR(...)`, added EET no-transform retry selection (`eetTransformRetryMax=3`), and switched minimize base replay precheck to 2-of-3 consensus; validated with targeted tests in `internal/generator`, `internal/oracle`, and `internal/runner` using Go 1.25.6-compatible toolchain with temp cache dirs.
- Addressed PR #116 review feedback for DQP external hints: added `*/` guard to block hint-comment breakout, classified malformed `SET_VAR(...)` as invalid (skip instead of base-hint fallback), and added regression coverage for unsafe/malformed external hint inputs plus `normalizeSetVarHint` classification; aligned notes to Go 1.25.6 for go.mod consistency; validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`, `go test ./internal/config`, and `go test ./cmd/shiro` (2026-02-15).
- Added DQP hint support for `SET_VAR(tidb_opt_partial_ordered_index_for_topn='COST'|'DISABLE')`, introduced config-driven external DQP hint injection via `oracles.dqp_external_hints` (supports full hint strings and raw `var=value` SET_VAR shorthand), and documented usage in README; validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`, `go test ./internal/config`, and `go test ./cmd/shiro` using Go 1.25.6 (2026-02-15).
- Addressed PR #113 review follow-ups for CI run-info ingestion: refactored startup run-info log format into a readable constant, fixed `SHIRO_CI` override semantics (ignore empty explicit value, preserve explicit `SHIRO_CI=false` when other `SHIRO_CI_*` metadata is provided), and kept `SHIRO_CI=true`-only runs as non-zero metadata; added/updated `internal/runinfo` tests and validated with `go test ./internal/runinfo` and `go test ./cmd/shiro` (with `GOROOT` unset and temp `GOCACHE`) (2026-02-15).
- Documented GitHub Actions secret/variable mapping for GCS (S3-compatible upload path) to explicit `storage.s3.*` config keys in README, including credential-chain usage via `AWS_*` env vars (2026-02-14).
- Improved CI integration by adding standardized `SHIRO_CI_*` environment mapping in GitHub Actions and wiring Shiro to collect runtime metadata from environment variables; metadata is now logged at startup and persisted into case summaries/report JSON as `run_info` (2026-02-14).
- Opened Worker read metadata endpoints (list/get/search/similar) to be token-free while keeping sync/patch writes token-protected, and updated report UI filters to support issue-based triage (`All issues` + `Only linked issue`) so tag/issue reads and issue-only bug views work without an API token; validated with `npm run compile`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:worker`, and `npm test` in `web/` (2026-02-15).
- Addressed PR #115 review follow-ups in report UI metadata cache flow: cache hydration now avoids overriding in-flight/worker-loaded state, metadata resolution order is enforced as Worker -> embedded report fields -> cache fallback, no-token 401 responses are memoized to avoid repeated fetch retries, and metadata cache writes are debounced/skipped when canonical payload is unchanged; also added non-production cache load/persist diagnostics; validated with `npm run compile`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` in `web/` (2026-02-15).
- Updated report UI metadata/repro visibility: tags/issues now render from resolved metadata sources (Worker when available, otherwise embedded/cached fallback) so triage badges stay visible even without a write token, and case detail now shows Min Repro SQL from `replay_sql` (with minimize status label when present); validated with `npm run compile`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` in `web/` (2026-02-15).
- Fixed PR #114 CI lint regression by removing stale, now-unreferenced `AnalyzeQueryFeatures` legacy helper functions from `internal/generator/features.go` after the single-pass refactor; validated with local `golangci-lint run --timeout=5m` and targeted generator/runner tests (2026-02-15).
- Addressed PR #114 review follow-ups: `AnalyzeQueryFeatures` now uses a primary single-pass expression walk (with recursive subquery/CTE merge) to avoid repeated full-query traversals, template strategy normalization is centralized in generator and reused by runner, and template-weight fallback logic now avoids duplicating config-level normalization; added/updated related generator+runner tests (2026-02-15).
- Reviewed the latest local run (`logs/shiro.log` + 17 `reports/*/summary.json`): all skipped captured cases remained minimize non-reproducible (`base_replay_not_reproducible`), GroundTruth stayed skip-dominant with DSG mismatch reasons (`base_table`/`right_key`), while DQP remained effective and QPG/template strategy counters (`join_filter` + `join_only`) were active (2026-02-15).
- Added runner-level QPG regression tests covering threshold-triggered adaptive overrides and TTL-based override retirement, and documented a CI-oriented QPG config snippet in README for short-run tuning (2026-02-14).
- Centralized non-template QPG adaptive thresholds and override TTL into config (`qpg.no_*_threshold`, `qpg.override_ttl`) and wired runner QPG adaptive weight overrides to use the config-driven values with normalization defaults (2026-02-14).
- Centralized QPG template override tuning knobs into config (`qpg.template_override`) with default/normalization handling for thresholds, boost weights, enabled probability, and TTL; runner template override logic now consumes config values instead of hard-coded constants (2026-02-14).
- Completed observability rollout for set operations / derived tables / quantified subqueries: QueryFeatures now recursively detects these across nested subqueries/CTEs, runner interval logs now emit per-interval counts and ratios, and generator/runner regression tests were added (2026-02-14).
- GroundTruth now auto-aligns effective max-row caps with TQS `wide_rows` in DSG mode to reduce `groundtruth:table_rows_exceeded` skip noise from cap mismatch, with regression tests for effective-cap selection (2026-02-14).
- Added generator/runner observability for `window_frame` and `interval_arith`: QueryFeatures now detects both, runner interval logs now report counts and ratios, and regression tests cover feature extraction plus stats accounting; ran `go test ./internal/...` (2026-02-14).
- Completed fuzz-optimization follow-up for CERT/DQP/TLP: CERT now enforces stronger build-time guardrails (disallowing aggregate/distinct/group-by/having/order-by/set-op/window shapes) to suppress `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` and ordering noise, and TLP now aligns with DQP on `PredicateModeSimpleColumns` to reduce `predicate_guard` skips without relaxing semantic checks; added regression tests (2026-02-14).
- Completed fuzz-optimization follow-ups for template predicates + GroundTruth edge extraction: template join predicates now use explicit weighted strategies (`join_only` vs `join_filter`) with interval observability in runner logs, and GroundTruth now builds join edges through a shared SQL-AST-preferred path used by both query-pick and execution flows; added regression tests plus config normalization coverage (2026-02-14).
- Reviewed a fresh local run (`logs/shiro.log`, `reports/case_0001..0003`): DQP had no `sql_error_1054` and kept effective ratio 1.0; EET `no_transform` skip dropped to ~10% in DQE interval, but GroundTruth remained skip-dominated (`dsg_key_mismatch_right_key`/`base_table`) with effective ratio 0; captured cases were EET/PQS missing-column errors and all were minimize non-reproducible (`base_replay_not_reproducible`) (2026-02-14).
- Implemented logs/reports follow-ups: GroundTruth now performs DSG prechecks (base/join key safety) plus right-key availability validation and uses higher pick retries; EET now falls back across rewrite kinds to reduce `eet:no_transform`; DQP now skips invalid-scope queries with `dqp:scope_invalid`; added regression tests (including NATURAL RIGHT JOIN qualified-column scope) and ran `go test ./internal/...` (2026-02-14).
- Reviewed local logs/reports sample (`logs/shiro.log` + 4 `reports/case_*/summary.json`): GroundTruth skips were dominated by `dsg_key_mismatch_right_key`/`empty_query`, EET skips were dominated by `eet:no_transform`, and 3/4 captured cases were `minimize_status=skipped` with `minimize_reason=base_replay_not_reproducible`; added targeted follow-up actions in `docs/todo.md` (2026-02-14).
- Addressed PR #110 follow-up review findings: hardened case summary path component sanitization against dot-segment traversal, made index `summary_url` prefer local `cases/<case_id>/summary.json` when case IDs exist (fallback to HTTP report URL only when no case ID), and aligned frontend inferred detail-loaded checks to treat empty `details` objects as not loaded (2026-02-13).
- Addressed PR #110 review threads: aligned frontend/backend search-blob empty-details handling, added abort/race guards for on-demand case detail fetches, and marked index entries without resolvable summary sources as `detail_loaded=true` to avoid broken lazy fetch attempts (2026-02-13).
- Completed report index + on-demand detail loading (P1): `cmd/shiro-report` now emits `reports.index.json` plus per-case `cases/<case_id>/summary.json`, publish flow includes all summary JSON files, and the report UI now loads `reports.index.json` first with lazy `summary_url` fetch on case expand (fallback to `reports.json`/`report.json` preserved) (2026-02-13).

- Addressed PR #108 review follow-ups in report UI metadata bootstrap: handled bootstrap promise errors safely, avoided marking missing cases as loaded on incomplete paging, preserved in-progress modal drafts during bootstrap merges, narrowed bootstrap effect dependencies with refs, and aligned PATCH auth header construction with shared helper (2026-02-13).
- Fixed report UI metadata persistence after refresh: page load now bootstraps case metadata from Worker `/api/v1/cases` (with auth header when token is set) so saved tags/issues remain visible after reload; similar-case API requests now also include the same auth header (2026-02-13).
- Fixed Cloudflare Git deploy config drift: root `wrangler.jsonc` now includes the Worker `DB` D1 binding, worker-local `wrangler.jsonc` binding is aligned to `DB`, and README documents that root config must include runtime bindings to avoid deploy-time binding loss (2026-02-13).
- Hardened logs/reports diagnostics: PQS now records pivot/containment error stages + SQL, deduplicates `USING(id)` projections to avoid ambiguous/missing-column failures, EET classifies runtime DISTINCT+ORDER BY (`3065`) as skip, and runner startup recovers stale `minimize_status=in_progress` summaries to `interrupted` with tests (2026-02-12).

- Added Cloudflare metadata plane skeleton under `web/cloudflare-worker/` with D1 schema, sync/list/patch/download APIs, and per-case similar-bug endpoint (`/api/v1/cases/:case_id/similar`) with optional AI summary (2026-02-06).
- Extended `cmd/shiro-report` with optional manifest publish flags (R2/S3-compatible) and optional Worker metadata sync callback; default behavior remains unchanged when flags are omitted (2026-02-06).
- Updated web report UI without changing core layout: added optional in-page similar-bug panel, Worker-backed archive download path, and `reports.json` fallback loading improvements (2026-02-06).
- Added compatibility guardrail: when `storage.s3.enabled=false`, keep legacy local reporting flow (`case_XXXX_uuid` directories and summary-only artifacts); enable UUID-as-path, per-case `report.json`, and `case.tar.zst` only in S3 cloud mode (2026-02-06).
- Updated report frontend to load `reports.json` with fallback to `report.json`, added waterfall/list view toggle, and added per-case archive/report download links (2026-02-06).
- Completed P1-P4 for fuzz cloud reporting baseline: switched case directories to UUIDv7 IDs, aligned runner/report/shiro-report `case_id`, generated per-case `report.json` plus `case.tar.zst`, uploaded S3 paths as `s3://<bucket>/<uuid>/...`, and made `cmd/shiro-report` emit both `report.json` and `reports.json` with archive/report URLs in entries (2026-02-06).
- Created branch `feat/fuzz-display-query-capability` in dedicated worktree for fuzz display/query capability enhancement; currently in requirements phase before implementation (2026-02-06).
- Captured requirements: use UUIDv7 as canonical bug id across runner/report/frontend, upload artifacts under `s3://<bucket>/<uuid>/`, push report manifests to Cloudflare for search, and support frontend archive download per case with Cloudflare Worker+D1+AI search infra (2026-02-06).
- Chosen cloud split for this project: case artifacts remain in S3, aggregated `reports.json` is published to Cloudflare R2, and metadata/tagging/search APIs run on Cloudflare Workers + D1 + AI search (2026-02-06).
- Refined profile constraint application to avoid relaxing subquery bans; simplified CERT/CODDTest builder setup; added override/profile regression tests (2026-02-08).

- Minimize pipeline was deeply refactored with strategy-based reduction (`case_error` vs replay-spec), multi-pass convergence (insert/case/spec alternating), validated insert-merge adoption, and weighted-candidate selection to avoid non-improving rewrites; added focused runner tests for merge validation, set-var dropping, and alternating reduction (2026-02-08).
- Impo seed-query guardrail skips now retain the last concrete failure reason (`seed_guardrail:<reason>`), and minimize now runs a mandatory base-replay precheck: non-reproducible cases are marked `minimize_status=skipped` plus top-level `flaky=true` with `minimize_reason`/`flaky_reason=base_replay_not_reproducible`; added regression tests (2026-02-07).
- GroundTruth now rewrites `USING` joins to explicit `ON` predicates before edge extraction/execution to avoid ambiguous `USING` resolution on multi-table left factors; EET adds stronger pre-guards (`scope_invalid`, DISTINCT+ORDER BY compatibility) and scope validation now treats NATURAL joins like USING for qualified-column visibility; report summaries switch minimize status flow to `in_progress/success/skipped/interrupted` with deferred interrupted fallback (2026-02-07).
- Reduced oracle skip noise by adding QuerySpec `MaxTries` for constrained builders (TLP/DQP/NoREC/EET), disallowing TLP set operations at build-time, retrying GroundTruth candidate picking across empty/guardrail/edge-mismatch cases, and retrying Impo seed-query selection before skip; added TLP set-op skip regression test (2026-02-07).
- Report capture now logs early case allocation and persists top-level `minimize_status` in `summary.json` (`disabled` / `not_applicable` / `in_progress` / `success` / `skipped` / `interrupted`) for better logs/reports consistency (2026-02-07).
- Fixed remaining PR-77 review items: render base/join aliases for non-derived table factors (generator/oracle SQL builders), enforce nested-query scope validation with resolver-backed table columns (including strict empty-column-set checks), and make FULL JOIN emulation use unqualified USING anti-filters to satisfy scope rules; added regression tests (2026-02-07).

- Scope manager now enforces `USING` column visibility for qualified references in query-body clauses (SELECT/WHERE/GROUP/HAVING/WINDOW/ORDER), with regression tests for hidden/common columns and preserved non-USING columns (2026-02-07).
- Systematically tightened NoREC query constraints by adding builder-level `DisallowSetOps`, refactoring shared constraint evaluation in `SelectQueryBuilder`, moving NoREC guardrails into `QueryGuardReason` (set-op / limit-without-order / predicate-subquery), and adding regression tests for constraint reasons and NoREC guard behavior (2026-02-07).
- P1 skip-reduction batch 1: tightened GroundTruth/CODDTest oracle overrides (disable views/derived/set-op/subquery-heavy features per oracle), switched CODDTest predicate mode to simple-columns, and widened CODDTest type guard to all supported scalar column types; added runner/oracle tests (2026-02-07).
- Added shared runner-side result annotation to classify `error_reason`/`bug_hint` (including PlanCache error paths) and tagged GroundTruth mismatches as `groundtruth:count_mismatch`; added runner unit tests for reason/hint mapping (2026-02-07).
- Disabled `INTERSECT ALL` generation for TiDB compatibility (matching existing `EXCEPT ALL` disablement) and added a regression test to ensure both stay non-ALL (2026-02-07).
- Hardened expression determinism/build paths against nil operands in `UnaryExpr`/`BinaryExpr`, and added regression coverage for nil binary operands to prevent `QueryDeterministic` panic (2026-02-07).
- Simplified `EXCEPT ALL` gating to the default non-ALL path and added a regression test to ensure `EXCEPT ALL` is never generated for TiDB compatibility (2026-02-07).
- Added broader SQL2023-focused tests: recursive CTE numeric guard, FULL JOIN emulation key-selection edge cases, named-window override rendering, grouping ordinal unwrap, window-def determinism, and oracle SQL helper fast-path/build coverage (2026-02-07).
- Added SQL2023-oriented generation features: NATURAL JOIN, FULL JOIN semantic emulation (`LEFT/RIGHT + UNION ALL`), recursive CTE (`WITH RECURSIVE`), window frame + named WINDOW clauses, GROUP BY WITH ROLLUP (+ GROUPING item), and INTERVAL arithmetic; added generator/oracle compatibility updates and tests (2026-02-06).
