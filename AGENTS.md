## Workflow guardrails

- After each task completes, review and update `AGENTS.md` and `docs/todo.md`, removing completed items and syncing current progress.
- Documentation must be written in English.
- When updating TiDB issues, collapse large SQL blocks (apply schema/load data) in `<details>` and format the "Run the query" SQL for readability.

## Recent updates

- Expanded P0 runtime-1105 reproducibility gate validation and docs (2026-02-21): added `disabled` and `not_applicable` regression coverage for `applyRuntime1105ReproGate`, including gate-reason preservation when `runtime_bug_hint_gate_reason` is pre-filled; documented runtime gate behavior/fields (`runtime_bug_hint_gated`, `runtime_bug_hint_gate_reason`) in `README.md`. Validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Completed P0 runtime-1105 reproducibility gate (2026-02-19): added runner-side gating so `error_reason=pqs:runtime_1105` only keeps `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error` when minimize reproduces (`minimize_status=success`); unreproducible/non-success paths now clear runtime bug hints and record `runtime_bug_hint_gated=true` in details to keep report-side runtime channels reproducibility-backed. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_report_test.go` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Closed P0 PQS runtime-1105 follow-up with evidence-driven triage (2026-02-19): added `docs/notes/pqs-runtime-1105-triage.md` and confirmed that the historical 2026-02-09 `PQS` MySQL `1105` (`index out of range`) signal remains non-reproducible with zero matches in current local `reports/*/summary.json`; decision is to keep runtime classification (`pqs:runtime_1105` + `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error`) and defer upstream issue filing until a reproducible sample appears.
- Started P0 PQS runtime-1105 triage hardening (2026-02-19): runner error classification now maps `PQS` MySQL `1105` errors that include `index out of range` to a dedicated reason `pqs:runtime_1105` with `bug_hint=tidb:runtime_error`, so report aggregation can isolate this suspected engine-runtime class from generic `sql_error_1105`; also replaced timeout MySQL magic codes with named constants in runner error helpers. Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_errors_test.go` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Fixed `revive` `confusing-results` lint findings in `internal/oracle/dqp.go` by switching `dqpExprConstBool` and `dqpLiteralAsBool` to named return values (`value`, `ok`) without behavior changes; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle` (2026-02-19).
- Continued logs/reports throughput hardening (2026-02-19, infra-aware fuzz adaptation): runner now tracks infra-unhealthy signals (`region_unavailable`, `schema_out_of_date`, `tikv_connectivity`) and feeds them into throughput controls with TTL-based unhealthy state; oracle scheduling now de-prioritizes heavy oracles under infra-unhealthy windows (`DQP`/`GroundTruth` disabled, `TLP`/`DQE` capped) while oracle timeout/infra ratios are penalized in oracle-bandit batch rewards; per-oracle query timeout now applies a stricter cap when infra-unhealthy is active (`infraOracleTimeoutCapMs=3000`), and interval logs now emit infra health markers/reason deltas (`infra_unhealthy`, `infra_ttl`, `infra_error_reasons`). Added regression tests in `internal/runner/runner_throughput_guard_test.go`, `internal/runner/runner_errors_test.go`, and `internal/runner/runner_bandit_reward_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`.
- Completed verification run for latest DQP hint/scope tuning (2026-02-19): re-ran targeted suites `./internal/config`, `./internal/oracle`, and `./internal/runner` with Go 1.25.7 + temp cache dirs, then executed short `go run ./cmd/shiro -config config.yaml` runtime smoke. Latest interval kept `sql_valid/total=5665/5665` with DQP stable at `run/66 eff/64 skip/2 err/0` and skip reasons limited to `dqp:scope_invalid` (no new `dqp:sql_error_1054` captured in this run window).
- Continued logs/reports follow-up (2026-02-19, DQP runtime hints + NATURAL JOIN scope): made DQP hint sampling limits config-driven via `oracles.dqp_base_hint_pick_limit` and `oracles.dqp_set_var_hint_pick_max` (default `3/3`, local `config.yaml` tuned to `6/8`) so runtime hint breadth can be raised without code edits; also disabled `NaturalJoins` in the DQP profile to reduce NATURAL-join-qualified-column `sql_error_1054` noise seen in short smoke runs. Added/updated tests in `internal/config/config_test.go`, `internal/oracle/dqp_test.go`, and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/config`, `... go test ./internal/oracle`, `... go test ./internal/runner`, plus repeated short `go run ./cmd/shiro -config config.yaml` checks (no immediate DQP 1054 recurrences in subsequent windows).
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, GroundTruth + NATURAL JOIN noise): tightened GroundTruth edge arbitration to prefer all-inner edge sets when key completeness is not worse, preventing non-inner SQL-edge selection from inflating `groundtruth:join_type` skips; additionally disabled `NaturalJoins` in NoREC/TLP oracle profiles to reduce NATURAL-join-qualified-column `sql_error_1054` noise. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle/groundtruth_oracle_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner`, and repeated `go run ./cmd/shiro -config config.yaml` smoke runs showing `GroundTruth` interval effectiveness recovered to `skip=0.000/effective=1.000`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, GroundTruth): reduced `groundtruth:join_type` skip pressure by tightening GroundTruth pick-time filters to reject non-inner extracted edge sets (not only non-inner generated joins), and added profile-level GroundTruth join-size cap (`max_join_tables=4`) applied via oracle overrides to avoid overly wide joins degrading effectiveness. Added regression coverage in `internal/oracle/groundtruth_oracle_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, DQP runtime hints): increased runtime DQP hint sampling slightly to improve per-query plan-variant coverage by raising base-hint pick limit from 2 to 3 and set-var hint pick range from `0..2` to `0..3`; updated DQP regression assertions accordingly. Validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle -run "TestDQPSetVarHintsCount|TestDQPHintsForQueryCount|TestDQP.*"` and `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, EET): reduced `eet:non_select` skip noise by disallowing set operations in the EET profile, adding EET query-spec guardrails (`DisallowSetOps` with `constraint:set_ops -> eet:set_ops`), and explicitly classifying parser `SetOprStmt` as `eet:set_ops` instead of generic `eet:non_select` for clearer diagnostics. Added regression coverage in `internal/oracle/eet_test.go` and `internal/runner/runner_oracle_overrides_test.go`; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19, P1/P2): tightened DQP query shaping for throughput stability by disabling derived tables/set operations in the DQP profile, forcing simple join-on policy for DQP, and adding builder constraints (`DisallowSetOps`, `MaxJoinCount=3`) plus `dqp:set_ops` skip mapping so high-complexity DQP candidates are filtered earlier; GroundTruth query picking now retries away from non-inner joins (`groundTruthHasOnlyInnerJoins`) instead of terminating a run on first unsupported join shape, reducing `groundtruth:join_type` skip pressure. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle` and `internal/runner`, validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports throughput follow-up (2026-02-19): added low-sample throughput guard in runner interval stats (`minSQLTotalPerInterval=200`, streak-triggered guard TTL with auto-recovery), DQP timeout cooldown gating in oracle selection, per-oracle timeout capping for DQP (`dqpOracleTimeoutCapMs=5000`), and interval observability enhancements (`qps`, low-sample/guard/cooldown state, timeout-reason deltas, `inflight_minimize`, and `stalled_reason`). Throughput guard now temporarily disables heavy generation features (set operations, derived tables, quantified subqueries, window funcs/frames, and high join-table caps) via oracle overrides while active. Added runner regression tests for guard activation, cooldown behavior, oracle-weight gating, timeout cap, and override feature throttling; validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Continued logs/reports follow-up batch for P0/P1/P2 (2026-02-18): runner now downgrades DQP timeout outcomes (`context deadline exceeded`, timeout-like MySQL codes 1317/3024) from bug capture to skip (`skip_reason=dqp:timeout`) to reduce low-value timeout cases; GroundTruth DSG query picking now broadens fallback eligibility to `base_table` (in addition to `right_key`) and increases fallback retries (`groundTruthDSGFallbackRetries=12`) to reduce strict DSG skip pressure; generator full-join candidate shaping now remains active in DSG mode so 2-table FULL JOIN emulation paths can still be sampled. Added/updated regression tests in `internal/runner`, `internal/oracle`, and `internal/generator`, validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner ./internal/oracle ./internal/generator`.
- Completed logs/reports follow-up batch (2026-02-18): EET now skips unstable rank-window signatures (`skip_reason=eet:window_rank_unstable_order`) when `ROW_NUMBER`/`RANK`/`DENSE_RANK` uses empty/constant ordering or partition-only ordering, reducing missing-column-like false captures from nondeterministic ties; GroundTruth now prefers DSG-valid edge sets during SQL-AST vs query-edge selection and allows a bounded non-DSG fallback pick path when strict DSG fails on `right_key` mismatch; PQS pivot picking now includes a shuffled table-scan fallback before returning `pqs:no_rows`. Added regression tests in `internal/oracle` and validated with `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle` and `GOCACHE=/tmp/shiro-gocache GOTMPDIR=/tmp/shiro-gotmp /Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner -run 'TestCollectGroundTruthDSGMismatchReasons|TestGroundTruthDSGMismatchReasonFromDetails|TestAnnotateResultForReportingGroundTruthMismatch'`.
- Completed fuzz follow-up batch for log/report optimization items 2/3/4/5 (2026-02-17): runner now downgrades EET/Impo/PQS `missing_column` outcomes from bug capture to skip (`skip_reason=<oracle>:missing_column`) to reduce false-positive case capture noise; GroundTruth edge selection now prefers DSG-valid edge sets before missing-key scoring and uses higher pick retries (`groundTruthPickRetries=16`) to reduce DSG mismatch skips; TQS mode switching now clears detached walker/history state and TQS interval logging now resets baseline on history rewind to avoid negative deltas after mode/database switches; generator table-picking now adds a dedicated 2-table candidate path when full-join emulation is enabled to improve `full_join_emulation` feature coverage. Added regression tests in `internal/runner`, `internal/oracle`, and `internal/generator`, validated with `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/generator`, `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/oracle`, and `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner` using temp cache dirs.
- Completed Generator/Oracles grouping-mode extension for TODO item #4 (2026-02-17): added SQL build support for `GROUP BY CUBE (...)` and `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (...)`, introduced `features.group_by_cube` and `features.group_by_grouping_sets`, centralized generator group-by extension selection/fallback logic, and wired profile-based fallback by disabling CUBE/GROUPING SETS in CERT/EET profiles while preserving rollup/plain behavior; added generator/config/runner regression tests and validated with `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/config`, `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/generator`, and `/Users/weizhenwang/.gvm/gos/go1.25.7/bin/go test ./internal/runner` (using temp `GOCACHE`/`GOTMPDIR`).
- Implemented fuzz optimization batch for follow-up items 1/2/3/4 (2026-02-16): fixed DSG join-key offset alignment (`tN -> k(N-1)`) in generator and GroundTruth checks to reduce `dsg_key_mismatch_right_key` skips, changed DQP hint bandit reward plus mismatch `replay_set_var` extraction for `SET_VAR(...)`, added EET no-transform retry selection (`eetTransformRetryMax=3`), and switched minimize base replay precheck to 2-of-3 consensus; validated with targeted tests in `internal/generator`, `internal/oracle`, and `internal/runner` using Go 1.25.6-compatible toolchain with temp cache dirs.
- Addressed PR #116 review feedback for DQP external hints: added `*/` guard to block hint-comment breakout, classified malformed `SET_VAR(...)` as invalid (skip instead of base-hint fallback), and added regression coverage for unsafe/malformed external hint inputs plus `normalizeSetVarHint` classification; aligned notes to Go 1.25.6 for go.mod consistency; validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`, `go test ./internal/config`, and `go test ./cmd/shiro` (2026-02-15).
- Added DQP hint support for `SET_VAR(tidb_opt_partial_ordered_index_for_topn='COST'|'DISABLE')`, introduced config-driven external DQP hint injection via `oracles.dqp_external_hints` (supports full hint strings and raw `var=value` SET_VAR shorthand), and documented usage in README; validated with `go test ./internal/oracle`, `go test ./internal/config`, and `go test ./cmd/shiro` using Go 1.25.6 (2026-02-15).
- Addressed PR #113 review follow-ups for CI run-info ingestion: refactored startup run-info log format into a readable constant, fixed `SHIRO_CI` override semantics (ignore empty explicit value, preserve explicit `SHIRO_CI=false` when other `SHIRO_CI_*` metadata is provided), and kept `SHIRO_CI=true`-only runs as non-zero metadata; added/updated `internal/runinfo` tests and validated with `go test ./internal/runinfo` and `go test ./cmd/shiro` (with `GOROOT` unset and temp `GOCACHE`) (2026-02-15).
- Documented GitHub Actions secret/variable mapping for GCS (S3-compatible upload path) to explicit `storage.s3.*` config keys in README, including credential-chain usage via `AWS_*` env vars (2026-02-14).
- Improved CI integration by adding standardized `SHIRO_CI_*` environment mapping in GitHub Actions and wiring Shiro to collect runtime metadata from environment variables; metadata is now logged at startup and persisted into case summaries/report JSON as `run_info` (2026-02-14).
- Opened Worker read metadata endpoints (list/get/search/similar) to be token-free while keeping sync/patch writes token-protected, and updated report UI filters to support issue-based triage (`All issues` + `Only linked issue`) so tag/issue reads and issue-only bug views work without an API token; validated with `npm run compile`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:worker`, and `npm test` in `web/` (2026-02-15).
- Addressed PR #115 review follow-ups in report UI metadata cache flow: cache hydration now avoids overriding in-flight/worker-loaded state, metadata resolution order is enforced as Worker -> embedded report fields -> cache fallback, no-token 401 responses are memoized to avoid repeated fetch retries, and metadata cache writes are debounced/skipped when canonical payload is unchanged; also added non-production cache load/persist diagnostics; validated with `npm run compile`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` in `web/` (2026-02-15).
- Updated report UI metadata/repro visibility: tags/issues now render from resolved metadata sources (Worker when available, otherwise embedded/cached fallback) so triage badges stay visible even without a write token, and case detail now shows Min Repro SQL from `replay_sql` (with minimize status label when present); validated with `npm run compile`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` in `web/` (2026-02-15).
- Fixed PR #114 CI lint regression by removing stale, now-unreferenced `AnalyzeQueryFeatures` legacy helper functions from `internal/generator/features.go` after the single-pass refactor; validated with local `golangci-lint run --timeout=5m` and targeted generator/runner tests (2026-02-15).
- Addressed PR #114 review follow-ups: `AnalyzeQueryFeatures` now uses a primary single-pass expression walk (with recursive subquery/CTE merge) to avoid repeated full-query traversals, template strategy normalization is centralized in generator and reused by runner, and template-weight fallback logic now avoids duplicating config-level normalization; added/updated related generator+runner tests (2026-02-15).
- Reviewed the latest local run (`logs/shiro.log` + 17 `reports/*/summary.json`): all skipped captured cases remained minimize non-reproducible (`base_replay_not_reproducible`), GroundTruth stayed skip-dominant with DSG mismatch reasons (`base_table`/`right_key`), while DQP remained effective and QPG/template strategy counters (`join_filter` + `join_only`) were active (2026-02-15).
- Added runner-level QPG regression tests covering threshold-triggered adaptive overrides and TTL-based override retirement, and documented a CI-oriented QPG config snippet in README for short-run tuning (2026-02-14).
- Centralized non-template QPG adaptive thresholds and override TTL into config (`qpg.no_*_threshold`, `qpg.override_ttl`) and wired runner QPG adaptive weight overrides to use the config-driven values with normalization defaults (2026-02-14).
- Centralized QPG template override tuning knobs into config (`qpg.template_override`) with default/normalization handling for thresholds, boost weights, enabled probability, and TTL; runner template override logic now consumes config values instead of hard-coded constants (2026-02-14).
- Completed observability rollout for set operations / derived tables / quantified subqueries: QueryFeatures now recursively detects these across nested subqueries/CTEs, runner interval logs now emit per-interval counts and ratios, and generator/runner regression tests were added (2026-02-14).
- GroundTruth now auto-aligns effective max-row caps with TQS `wide_rows` in DSG mode to reduce `groundtruth:table_rows_exceeded` skip noise from cap mismatch, with regression tests for effective-cap selection (2026-02-14).
- Added generator/runner observability for `window_frame` and `interval_arith`: QueryFeatures now detects both, runner interval logs now report counts and ratios, and regression tests cover feature extraction plus stats accounting; ran `go test ./internal/...` (2026-02-14).
- Completed fuzz-optimization follow-up for CERT/DQP/TLP: CERT now enforces stronger build-time guardrails (disallowing aggregate/distinct/group-by/having/order-by/set-op/window shapes) to suppress `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` and ordering noise, and TLP now aligns with DQP on `PredicateModeSimpleColumns` to reduce `predicate_guard` skips without relaxing semantic checks; added regression tests (2026-02-14).
- Completed fuzz-optimization follow-ups for template predicates + GroundTruth edge extraction: template join predicates now use explicit weighted strategies (`join_only` vs `join_filter`) with interval observability in runner logs, and GroundTruth now builds join edges through a shared SQL-AST-preferred path used by both query-pick and execution flows; added regression tests plus config normalization coverage (2026-02-14).
- Reviewed a fresh local run (`logs/shiro.log`, `reports/case_0001..0003`): DQP had no `sql_error_1054` and kept effective ratio 1.0; EET `no_transform` skip dropped to ~10% in DQE interval, but GroundTruth remained skip-dominated (`dsg_key_mismatch_right_key`/`base_table`) with effective ratio 0; captured cases were EET/PQS missing-column errors and all were minimize non-reproducible (`base_replay_not_reproducible`) (2026-02-14).
- Implemented logs/reports follow-ups: GroundTruth now performs DSG prechecks (base/join key safety) plus right-key availability validation and uses higher pick retries; EET now falls back across rewrite kinds to reduce `eet:no_transform`; DQP now skips invalid-scope queries with `dqp:scope_invalid`; added regression tests (including NATURAL RIGHT JOIN qualified-column scope) and ran `go test ./internal/...` (2026-02-14).
- Reviewed local logs/reports sample (`logs/shiro.log` + 4 `reports/case_*/summary.json`): GroundTruth skips were dominated by `dsg_key_mismatch_right_key`/`empty_query`, EET skips were dominated by `eet:no_transform`, and 3/4 captured cases were `minimize_status=skipped` with `minimize_reason=base_replay_not_reproducible`; added targeted follow-up actions in `docs/todo.md` (2026-02-14).
- Addressed PR #110 follow-up review findings: hardened case summary path component sanitization against dot-segment traversal, made index `summary_url` prefer local `cases/<case_id>/summary.json` when case IDs exist (fallback to HTTP report URL only when no case ID), and aligned frontend inferred detail-loaded checks to treat empty `details` objects as not loaded (2026-02-13).
- Addressed PR #110 review threads: aligned frontend/backend search-blob empty-details handling, added abort/race guards for on-demand case detail fetches, and marked index entries without resolvable summary sources as `detail_loaded=true` to avoid broken lazy fetch attempts (2026-02-13).
- Completed report index + on-demand detail loading (P1): `cmd/shiro-report` now emits `reports.index.json` plus per-case `cases/<case_id>/summary.json`, publish flow includes all summary JSON files, and the report UI now loads `reports.index.json` first with lazy `summary_url` fetch on case expand (fallback to `reports.json`/`report.json` preserved) (2026-02-13).
- Addressed PR #109 review follow-ups in report UI: simplified `caseRenderKey`, cleaned search-blob construction to avoid null-detail noise, fixed disabled button hover behavior, and added pagination `aria-label`s for accessibility (2026-02-13).
- Improved report UI query efficiency (P0): added debounced + deferred keyword search, prebuilt per-case search blobs to avoid repeated string assembly during filtering, introduced client-side pagination (30 cases/page), and lazily rendered heavy case body blocks only after row expansion (2026-02-13).
- Addressed PR #108 review follow-ups in report UI metadata bootstrap: handled bootstrap promise errors safely, avoided marking missing cases as loaded on incomplete paging, preserved in-progress modal drafts during bootstrap merges, narrowed bootstrap effect dependencies with refs, and aligned PATCH auth header construction with shared helper (2026-02-13).
- Fixed report UI metadata persistence after refresh: page load now bootstraps case metadata from Worker `/api/v1/cases` (with auth header when token is set) so saved tags/issues remain visible after reload; similar-case API requests now also include the same auth header (2026-02-13).
- Fixed Cloudflare Git deploy config drift: root `wrangler.jsonc` now includes the Worker `DB` D1 binding, worker-local `wrangler.jsonc` binding is aligned to `DB`, and README documents that root config must include runtime bindings to avoid deploy-time binding loss (2026-02-13).
- Hardened logs/reports diagnostics: PQS now records pivot/containment error stages + SQL, deduplicates `USING(id)` projections to avoid ambiguous/missing-column failures, EET classifies runtime DISTINCT+ORDER BY (`3065`) as skip, and runner startup recovers stale `minimize_status=in_progress` summaries to `interrupted` with tests (2026-02-12).
- Added Worker-side 500 logging with request_id for easier troubleshooting (2026-02-12).
- Allowed tag/issue saves even when metadata was not preloaded (2026-02-12).
- Treat metadata 404 as empty meta in the UI so empty queries do not surface errors (2026-02-12).
- Secured worker list/search/similar endpoints behind read auth and documented metadata-only similarity/search behavior (2026-02-12).
- Enabled top-level worker observability flag to match nested log settings (2026-02-12).
- Slimmed the Worker D1 schema to store only case_id/labels/linked_issue and simplified sync/list/similar logic to metadata-only (2026-02-12).
- Dropped the Worker download endpoint and switched UI downloads to use report archive URLs directly (2026-02-12).
- Embedded the report UI into the Worker assets pipeline with a build:worker export flow and same-origin fallback (2026-02-12).
- Disabled Turbopack for build:worker to avoid font loader resolution failures in Worker builds (2026-02-12).
- Added tag/issue toggles with issue-link rendering in the report UI (2026-02-12).
- Added preset label chips plus label-based filtering support in the report UI (2026-02-12).
- Switched tag/issue editing to a modal with add/remove presets and issue linking (2026-02-12).
- Enabled modal dismissal via Escape key and backdrop click (2026-02-12).
- Added Cloudflare Worker observability settings to wrangler.jsonc (2026-02-12).
- Ignored local Cloudflare worker dev artifacts, plus added wrangler devDependency for worker tooling (2026-02-12).
- Synced web package-lock for wrangler devDependency to keep npm ci green (2026-02-12).
- Secured case-metadata GET behind API token when configured, narrowed metadata payloads, and store write tokens in session storage (2026-02-12).
- Removed the waterfall view selector from the report UI (2026-02-11).
- Moved worker write-token input from Filters to a Settings panel in the report UI (2026-02-11).
- Cloudflare Worker now exposes per-case metadata and report UI supports tagging/issue linking via token-authenticated PATCH (2026-02-11).
- Report UI orders case detail sections as error, schema.sql, data.tsv, then case.sql (2026-02-11).
- Report UI now hides Expected/Actual blocks independently when their text is empty (2026-02-11).
- Report UI hides the Open report.json action and keeps report.json folded by default (2026-02-11).
- Report UI now maps `gs://` artifact locations to public GCS URLs for downloads (2026-02-11).
- Report UI hides `case.tar.zst` content and presents a single download-case action per bug (2026-02-11).
- Simplified USING ambiguity checks to reuse a single left-side column collection pass (2026-02-11).
