## Workflow guardrails

- After each task completes, review and update `AGENTS.md` and `docs/todo.md`, removing completed items and syncing current progress.
- Documentation must be written in English.

## Recent updates

- Added SQL2023-oriented generation features: NATURAL JOIN, FULL JOIN semantic emulation (`LEFT/RIGHT + UNION ALL`), recursive CTE (`WITH RECURSIVE`), window frame + named WINDOW clauses, GROUP BY WITH ROLLUP (+ GROUPING item), and INTERVAL arithmetic; added generator/oracle compatibility updates and tests (2026-02-06).
- Added `docs/argus.md` from paper `2510.06663v1` (Argus): CAQ-based oracle discovery with solver-backed verification and snippet-corpus instantiation flow (2026-02-06).
- Read OSDI20 Rigger and added `docs/pqs.md` with a staged PQS integration outline; synced TODO/follow-ups with actionable PQS tasks (2026-02-06).
- Fixed set-op scope visibility (operand tables no longer leak into main-query scope), enabled derived-table generation in template FROM paths, and made SubqueryExpr/ExistsExpr determinism checks recurse into subqueries; added regression tests (2026-02-06).
- Added feature-flagged SQL capability groundwork for set operations (`UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT`), derived tables (`FROM/JOIN (subquery) AS alias`), and quantified subqueries (`ANY/SOME/ALL`), plus recursive query-analysis/oracle helper coverage and tests (2026-02-06).
