## Workflow guardrails

- After each task completes, review and update `AGENTS.md` and `docs/todo.md`, removing completed items and syncing current progress.
- Documentation must be written in English.
- When updating TiDB issues, collapse large SQL blocks (apply schema/load data) in `<details>` and format the "Run the query" SQL for readability.

## Recent updates

- Moved completed Impo roadmap items out of TODO tracking and recorded them in feature notes (2026-02-08).
- Enhanced PQS pivot sampling with `id`-range selection (avoids `ORDER BY RAND()`), added basic two-table `JOIN ... USING (id)` pivots with alias-aware matching, switched containment checks to `LIMIT 1` existence probes, and enabled a default PQS oracle weight (2026-02-08).
- Added PQS v1 oracle (single-table pivot selection, equality/IS NULL predicates, containment check), wired weights/overrides/config, and expanded unit tests (2026-02-08).
- Updated the remaining report diff viewer `compareMethod` usage to the `DiffMethod.WORDS_WITH_SPACE` enum to satisfy Next.js type checks (2026-02-09).
- Switched the report diff viewer `compareMethod` to use the `DiffMethod.WORDS_WITH_SPACE` enum for type-safe Next.js builds (2026-02-09).
- Replaced the `JSX.Element` type alias in the report page with `ReactNode` to avoid missing JSX namespace errors during Next.js builds (2026-02-09).
- Hardened compute worker webpack replacement plugin resolution so CI tests do not fail when `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` is missing from the bundled webpack export (2026-02-09).
- Configured Next.js alias/extension alias to map `computeWorker.ts` to the shipped `computeWorker.js` and updated the worker verification test for the web report build (2026-02-09).
- Guarded `next build` behind a release flag so local defaults use `next dev`, and added a `build:release` script for optimized builds (2026-02-09).
- Switched the default `next dev` script to `--turbo` and added `dev:webpack` for a webpack fallback (2026-02-09).

- Documented web worker override upgrade guidance in `docs/notes/feature.md` (2026-02-09).
- Adjusted flaky errno test to use non-fatal assertions (2026-02-09).
- Fixed lint follow-ups: `cmd/shiro-report` now closes worker sync HTTP response bodies via `resp.Body.Close()` (for `bodyclose`) and `internal/report` now documents exported case-archive constants (`CaseArchiveName`/`CaseArchiveCodec`) to satisfy `revive` (2026-02-08).
- Addressed PR #78 review findings: Worker now defaults writes to deny without token (optional `ALLOW_INSECURE_WRITES` for local dev), enforces request body/sync-case limits, adds `Vary: Origin`, fixes PATCH empty-payload semantics, normalizes download/report/archive URLs to HTTP(S), hardens AI prompt user-input delimiters, and updates shiro-report with `-artifact-public-base-url`, worker sync timeout/error handling, and S3 listing-based sidecar detection; frontend now hides non-HTTP(S) artifact links (2026-02-07).
- CI: added a dedicated frontend pipeline job in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` that runs web compile (`tsc --noEmit`), lint, and tests; backend/integration job now depends on the web job (2026-02-06).
- Added `web/lib/report-utils.ts` and unit tests (`web/test/report-utils.test.ts`) to cover report URL/case-id/worker-link derivation used by the frontend (2026-02-06).
- Added Cloudflare metadata plane skeleton under `web/cloudflare-worker/` with D1 schema, sync/list/patch/download APIs, and per-case similar-bug endpoint (`/api/v1/cases/:case_id/similar`) with optional AI summary (2026-02-06).
- Extended `cmd/shiro-report` with optional manifest publish flags (R2/S3-compatible) and optional Worker metadata sync callback; default behavior remains unchanged when flags are omitted (2026-02-06).
- Updated web report UI without changing core layout: added optional in-page similar-bug panel, Worker-backed archive download path, and `reports.json` fallback loading improvements (2026-02-06).
- Added compatibility guardrail: when `storage.s3.enabled=false`, keep legacy local reporting flow (`case_XXXX_uuid` directories and summary-only artifacts); enable UUID-as-path, per-case `report.json`, and `case.tar.zst` only in S3 cloud mode (2026-02-06).
- Updated report frontend to load `reports.json` with fallback to `report.json`, added waterfall/list view toggle, and added per-case archive/report download links (2026-02-06).
- Completed P1-P4 for fuzz cloud reporting baseline: switched case directories to UUIDv7 IDs, aligned runner/report/shiro-report `case_id`, generated per-case `report.json` plus `case.tar.zst`, uploaded S3 paths as `s3://<bucket>/<uuid>/...`, and made `cmd/shiro-report` emit both `report.json` and `reports.json` with archive/report URLs in entries (2026-02-06).
- Created branch `feat/fuzz-display-query-capability` in dedicated worktree for fuzz display/query capability enhancement; currently in requirements phase before implementation (2026-02-06).
- Captured requirements: use UUIDv7 as canonical bug id across runner/report/frontend, upload artifacts under `s3://<bucket>/<uuid>/`, push report manifests to Cloudflare for search, and support frontend archive download per case with Cloudflare Worker+D1+AI search infra (2026-02-06).
- Chosen cloud split for this project: case artifacts remain in S3, aggregated `reports.json` is published to Cloudflare R2, and metadata/tagging/search APIs run on Cloudflare Workers + D1 + AI search (2026-02-06).
- Refined profile constraint application to avoid relaxing subquery bans; simplified CERT/CODDTest builder setup; added override/profile regression tests (2026-02-08).
- NoREC profile now disables set operations; added profile-constraint mapping tests and SelectQueryBuilder analysis refresh regression coverage (2026-02-08).
- Renamed oracle profile types/helpers to avoid revive stutter warnings (2026-02-08).
- QuerySpec now accepts oracle profiles so generator constraints can be derived from the same capability gating used by runtime overrides (2026-02-08).
- Centralized query analysis reuse in SelectQueryBuilder to avoid redundant AST walks while keeping determinism checks accurate (2026-02-08).
- Replaced hard-coded oracle overrides with data-driven profiles for easier tuning and more consistent capability gating (2026-02-08).

- SelectQueryBuilder now invalidates cached analysis after attaching predicates so determinism checks stay accurate (2026-02-08).
- Minimize pipeline was deeply refactored with strategy-based reduction (`case_error` vs replay-spec), multi-pass convergence (insert/case/spec alternating), validated insert-merge adoption, and weighted-candidate selection to avoid non-improving rewrites; added focused runner tests for merge validation, set-var dropping, and alternating reduction (2026-02-08).
- Impo seed-query guardrail skips now retain the last concrete failure reason (`seed_guardrail:<reason>`), and minimize now runs a mandatory base-replay precheck: non-reproducible cases are marked `minimize_status=skipped` plus top-level `flaky=true` with `minimize_reason`/`flaky_reason=base_replay_not_reproducible`; added regression tests (2026-02-07).
- GroundTruth now rewrites `USING` joins to explicit `ON` predicates before edge extraction/execution to avoid ambiguous `USING` resolution on multi-table left factors; EET adds stronger pre-guards (`scope_invalid`, DISTINCT+ORDER BY compatibility) and scope validation now treats NATURAL joins like USING for qualified-column visibility; report summaries switch minimize status flow to `in_progress/success/skipped/interrupted` with deferred interrupted fallback (2026-02-07).
- Reduced oracle skip noise by adding QuerySpec `MaxTries` for constrained builders (TLP/DQP/NoREC/EET), disallowing TLP set operations at build-time, retrying GroundTruth candidate picking across empty/guardrail/edge-mismatch cases, and retrying Impo seed-query selection before skip; added TLP set-op skip regression test (2026-02-07).
- Report capture now logs early case allocation and persists top-level `minimize_status` in `summary.json` (`disabled` / `not_applicable` / `in_progress` / `success` / `skipped` / `interrupted`) for better logs/reports consistency (2026-02-07).
- Fixed remaining PR-77 review items: render base/join aliases for non-derived table factors (generator/oracle SQL builders), enforce nested-query scope validation with resolver-backed table columns (including strict empty-column-set checks), and make FULL JOIN emulation use unqualified USING anti-filters to satisfy scope rules; added regression tests (2026-02-07).
- Removed two `ineffassign` findings by deleting an unused `lastKeyReason` assignment in GroundTruth query picking and simplifying DSG mismatch label initialization in runner stats (2026-02-07).
- Report metadata now surfaces `groundtruth_dsg_mismatch_reason` at summary/index top level (runner summary write + shiro-report case entry), with runner tests covering detail/skip-reason extraction (2026-02-07).
- Added top-level interval aggregation for `groundtruth_dsg_mismatch_reason` from GroundTruth skip deltas and covered the parser/aggregation with runner unit tests (2026-02-07).

- Systematically fixed PR-77 follow-ups: normalized set-operation ORDER/LIMIT handling to avoid branch-only binding, unified inline-subquery `WITH` guardrails across scalar/EXISTS/quantified expressions, and aligned runner `bug_hint` to `tidb:plan_reference_missing`; added regression tests (2026-02-07).
- Scope manager now enforces `USING` column visibility for qualified references in query-body clauses (SELECT/WHERE/GROUP/HAVING/WINDOW/ORDER), with regression tests for hidden/common columns and preserved non-USING columns (2026-02-07).
- Systematically tightened NoREC query constraints by adding builder-level `DisallowSetOps`, refactoring shared constraint evaluation in `SelectQueryBuilder`, moving NoREC guardrails into `QueryGuardReason` (set-op / limit-without-order / predicate-subquery), and adding regression tests for constraint reasons and NoREC guard behavior (2026-02-07).
- P1 skip-reduction batch 1: tightened GroundTruth/CODDTest oracle overrides (disable views/derived/set-op/subquery-heavy features per oracle), switched CODDTest predicate mode to simple-columns, and widened CODDTest type guard to all supported scalar column types; added runner/oracle tests (2026-02-07).
- Added shared runner-side result annotation to classify `error_reason`/`bug_hint` (including PlanCache error paths) and tagged GroundTruth mismatches as `groundtruth:count_mismatch`; added runner unit tests for reason/hint mapping (2026-02-07).
- Disabled `INTERSECT ALL` generation for TiDB compatibility (matching existing `EXCEPT ALL` disablement) and added a regression test to ensure both stay non-ALL (2026-02-07).
- Hardened expression determinism/build paths against nil operands in `UnaryExpr`/`BinaryExpr`, and added regression coverage for nil binary operands to prevent `QueryDeterministic` panic (2026-02-07).
- Simplified `EXCEPT ALL` gating to the default non-ALL path and added a regression test to ensure `EXCEPT ALL` is never generated for TiDB compatibility (2026-02-07).
- Added broader SQL2023-focused tests: recursive CTE numeric guard, FULL JOIN emulation key-selection edge cases, named-window override rendering, grouping ordinal unwrap, window-def determinism, and oracle SQL helper fast-path/build coverage (2026-02-07).
- Added SQL2023-oriented generation features: NATURAL JOIN, FULL JOIN semantic emulation (`LEFT/RIGHT + UNION ALL`), recursive CTE (`WITH RECURSIVE`), window frame + named WINDOW clauses, GROUP BY WITH ROLLUP (+ GROUPING item), and INTERVAL arithmetic; added generator/oracle compatibility updates and tests (2026-02-06).
